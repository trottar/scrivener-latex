  \caption{The dressed-quark mass function, M(p), versus momentum which shows the rapid aquisition of mass via the gluon cloud as a result of DCSB. The DSE results are the solid curves and the pseudodata points are produced from numerical simulations of lattice-regularized QCD [\cite{roberts_hadron_2015}].}
