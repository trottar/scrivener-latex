  \caption{\emph{Left:} Comparison of uncertainties on the pion's valence, sea quark, and gluon PDFs before (yellow bands) and after (red bands) inclusion of EIC data.
    \emph{Right:} Ratio of uncertainties with EIC data to without, $\delta^{\rm EIC}/\delta$, for the valence (green line), sea quark (blue), and gluon (red) PDFs. A 1.2\% experimental systematic uncertainty was assumed (no model systematic uncertainty).}
