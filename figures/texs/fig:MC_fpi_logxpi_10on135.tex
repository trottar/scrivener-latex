  \caption{Monte Carlo projections for the pion structure function vs $x$ at a beam energy of 10$\times$135. In this projection, the data was binned in $x$ and $Q^2$, with bin sizes of 0.001 and 10\,$\mathrm{GeV}^2$, respectively. The Monte Carlo projections for $Q^2$ values of 60, 120, 240, 480\,GeV$^2/c$ are represented by dark blue points. For a luminosity of 100\,$\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$, the statistical uncertainties are represented by light blue bands.}
