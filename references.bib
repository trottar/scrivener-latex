	abstract = {The 1H(e,e′K+)Λ reaction was studied as a function of the Mandelstam variable −t using data from the E01-004 (FPI-2) and E93-018 experiments that were carried out in Hall C at the 6 GeV Jefferson Laboratory. The cross section was fully separated into longitudinal and transverse components, and two interference terms at four-momentum transfers Q2 of 1.00, 1.36, and 2.07GeV2. The kaon form factor was extracted from the longitudinal cross section using the Regge model by Vanderhaeghen et al. [Phys. Rev. C 57, 1454 (1998)]. The results establish the method, previously used successfully for pion analyses, for extracting the kaon form factor. Data from 12 GeV Jefferson Laboratory experiments are expected to have sufficient precision to distinguish between theoretical predictions, for example, recent perturbative QCD calculations with modern parton distribution amplitudes. The leading-twist behavior for light mesons is predicted to set in for values of Q2 between 5 and 10GeV2, which makes data in the few-GeV regime particularly interesting. The Q2 dependence at fixed x and −t of the longitudinal cross section that we extracted seems consistent with the QCD factorization prediction within the experimental uncertainty.},

	abstract = {Understanding the origin and dynamics of hadron structure and in turn that of atomic nuclei is a central goal of nuclear physics. This challenge entails the questions of how does the roughly 1GeV mass-scale that characterizes atomic nuclei appear; why does it have the observed value; and, enigmatically, why are the composite Nambu-Goldstone (NG) bosons in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) abnormally light in comparison? In this perspective, we provide an analysis of the mass budget of the pion and proton in QCD; discuss the special role of the kaon, which lies near the boundary between dominance of strong and Higgs mass-generation mechanisms; and explain the need for a coherent effort in QCD phenomenology and continuum calculations, in exa-scale computing as provided by lattice QCD, and in experiments to make progress in understanding the origins of hadron masses and the distribution of that mass within them. We compare the unique capabilities foreseen at the electron-ion collider (EIC) with those at the hadron-electron ring accelerator (HERA), the only previous electron-proton collider; and describe five key experimental measurements, enabled by the EIC and aimed at delivering fundamental insights that will generate concrete answers to the questions of how mass and structure arise in the pion and kaon, the Standard Model's NG modes, whose surprisingly low mass is critical to the evolution of our Universe.},

	abstract = {The questions of how the bulk of the Universe’s visible mass emerges and how it is manifest in the existence and properties of hadrons are profound, and probe the heart of strongly interacting matter. Paradoxically, the lightest pseudoscalar mesons appear to be key to a further understanding of the emergent mass and structure mechanisms. These mesons, namely, the pion and kaon, are the Nambu–Goldstone boson modes of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Unravelling their partonic structure and the interplay between emergent and Higgs-boson mass mechanisms is a common goal of three interdependent approaches—continuum QCD phenomenology, lattice-regularised QCD, and the global analysis of parton distributions—linked to experimental measurements of hadron structure. Experimentally, the anticipated electron–ion collider will enable a revolution in our ability to study pion and kaon structures, accessed by scattering from the ‘meson cloud’ of the proton through the Sullivan process. With the goal of enabling a suite of measurements that can address these questions, we examine key reactions that identify the critical detector-system requirements needed to map tagged pion and kaon cross-sections over a wide range of kinematics. The excellent prospects for extracting pion structural, functional, and form-factor data are outlined, and similar prospects for kaon structures are discussed in the context of a worldwide programme. The successful completion of the programme outlined herein will deliver deep, far-reaching insights into the emergence of pions and kaons, their properties, and their role as QCD’s Goldstone boson modes.},

	abstract = {This article presents a collection of simulation studies using the ECCE detector concept in the context of the EIC's exclusive, diffractive, and tagging physics program, which aims to further explore the rich quark-gluon structure of nucleons and nuclei. To successfully execute the program, ECCE proposed to utilize the detecter system close to the beamline to ensure exclusivity and tag ion beam/fragments for a particular reaction of interest. Preliminary studies confirmed the proposed technology and design satisfy the requirements. The projected physics impact results are based on the projected detector performance from the simulation at 10 or 100 fb{\textasciicircum}-1 of integrated luminosity. Additionally, a few insights on the potential 2nd Interaction Region can (IR) were also documented which could serve as a guidepost for the future development of a second EIC detector.},

	abstract = {This report describes the physics case, the resulting detector requirements, and the evolving detector concepts for the experimental program at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). The EIC will be a powerful new high-luminosity facility in the United States with the capability to collide high-energy electron beams with high-energy proton and ion beams, providing access to those regions in the nucleon and nuclei where their structure is dominated by gluons. Moreover, polarized beams in the EIC will give unprecedented access to the spatial and spin structure of the proton, neutron, and light ions. The studies leading to this document were commissioned and organized by the EIC User Group with the objective of advancing the state and detail of the physics program and developing detector concepts that meet the emerging requirements in preparation for the realization of the EIC. The effort aims to provide the basis for further development of concepts for experimental equipment best suited for the science needs, including the importance of two complementary detectors and interaction regions. This report consists of three volumes. Volume I is an executive summary of our findings and developed concepts. In Volume II we describe studies of a wide range of physics measurements and the emerging requirements on detector acceptance and performance. Volume III discusses general-purpose detector concepts and the underlying technologies to meet the physics requirements. These considerations will form the basis for a world-class experimental program that aims to increase our understanding of the fundamental structure of all visible matter},

	abstract = {Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the strongly interacting part of the Standard Model. It is supposed to describe all of nuclear physics; and yet, almost ﬁfty years after the discovery of gluons and quarks, we are only just beginning to understand how QCD builds the basic bricks for nuclei: neutrons and protons, and the pions that bind them together. QCD is characterised by two emergent phenomena: conﬁnement and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (DCSB). They have far-reaching consequences, expressed with great force in the character of the pion; and pion properties, in turn, suggest that conﬁnement and DCSB are intimately connected. Indeed, since the pion is both a NambuGoldstone boson and a quark-antiquark bound-state, it holds a unique position in Nature and, consequently, developing an understanding of its properties is critical to revealing some very basic features of the Standard Model. We describe experimental progress toward meeting this challenge that has been made using electromagnetic probes, highlighting both dramatic improvements in the precision of charged-pion form factor data that have been achieved in the past decade and new results on the neutral-pion transition form factor, both of which challenge existing notions of pion structure. We also provide a theoretical context for these empirical advances, which begins with an explanation of how DCSB works to guarantee that the pion is unnaturally light; but also, nevertheless, ensures that the pion is the best object to study in order to reveal the mechanisms that generate nearly all the mass of hadrons. In canvassing advances in these areas, our discussion uniﬁes many aspects of pion structure and interactions, connecting the charged-pion elastic form factor, the neutral-pion transition form factor and the pion’s leading-twist parton distribution amplitude. It also sketches novel ways in which experimental and theoretical studies of the charged-kaon electromagnetic form factor can provide signiﬁcant contributions. Importantly, it appears that recent predictions for the large-Q2 behaviour of the chargedpion form factor can be tested by experiments planned at the upgraded 12 GeV Jeﬀerson Laboratory. Those experiments will extend precise charged-pion form factor data up to momentum transfers that it now appears may be large enough to serve in validating factorisation theorems in QCD. If so, they may expose the transition between the nonperturbative and perturbative domains and thereby reach a goal that has driven hadro-particle physics for around thirty-ﬁve years.},

	abstract = {These lectures explain that comparisons between experiment and theory can expose the impact of running couplings and masses on hadron observables and thereby aid materially in charting the momentum dependence of the interaction that underlies stronginteraction dynamics. The series begins with a primer on continuum QCD, which introduces some of the basic ideas necessary in order to understand the use of Schwinger functions as a nonperturbative tool in hadron physics. It continues with a discussion of conﬁnement and dynamical symmetry breaking (DCSB) in the Standard Model, and the impact of these phenomena on our understanding of condensates, the parton structure of hadrons, and the pion electromagnetic form factor. The ﬁnal lecture treats the problem of grand uniﬁcation; namely, the contemporary use of Schwinger functions as a symmetry-preserving tool for the uniﬁed explanation and prediction of the properties of both mesons and baryons. It reveals that DCSB drives the formation of diquark clusters in baryons and sketches a picture of baryons as bound-states with Borromean character. Planned experiments are capable of validating the perspectives outlined in these lectures.},

	abstract = {A concept for simultaneous beam delivery to all four CEBAF experimental halls from a single injector and a single main accelerator for the 12 GeV era was proposed in 2012. The original 12 GeV beam delivery plan was for a maximum of three experimental halls at a time as in the 6 GeV era. Therefore, the new concept increases the potential beam time for the experiments up to 33\%. This change, although a major improvement in operational capabilities, required only limited modifications to the existing machine. The modifications were mainly timing and pattern changes to the beams in the injector, adding a fourth laser to the photo-cathode gun, and the addition of new RF separators to the highest pass of CEBAF. These changes are now complete and, for the first time, the full system is operating, producing four simultaneous beams through the accelerator to four different destinations. In this paper, in addition to presenting the results of the full system commissioning, we will discuss important details about the new configuration plus some of our operational challenges.},

	abstract = {As part of the CEBAF 12 GeV upgrade at Jefferson Lab, a new experimental hall was added to the existing three halls. To deliver beam to all four halls simultaneous-ly, a new timing pattern for electron bunches is needed at the injector. This pattern change has consequences for the frequency of the lasers at the photogun, beam behavior in the chopping system, beam optics due to space charge, and setup procedures. We have successfully demonstrated this new pattern using the three existing drive lasers. The implementation of the full system will occur when the fourth laser is added and upgrades to the Low Level RF (LLRF) are complete. In this paper we explain the new bunch pattern, the challenges for setting and measuring the pattern such as 180° RF phase ambiguity, addition of the fourth laser to the laser table and LLRF upgrade.},

	abstract = {The CEBAF accelerator provides interleaved 499 MHz electron beams, spanning 5 decades in beam intensity (a few nA to 200 µA), to three experimental halls simultaneously. The physics program became more challenging when the G0 experiment was approved, requiring more than six times higher bunch charge than is routine. This experiment requires up to 8 million electrons per bunch at a reduced repetition rate of 31 MHz, while the lowest current hall simultaneously receives 100 electrons per bunch. A bunch destined for one hall may experience significant space charge forces, while the next bunch may have negligible space charge. This disparity in beam intensity must be maintained while delivering “best ever” values in rms beam quality, including relative energy spread ({\textless}2.5x10-5) and normalized transverse emittance ({\textless}1 mm-mrad). Space charge difficulties emerge in the 10m long, 100 keV section of the CEBAF injector during initial bunch formation and spin manipulation. A series of changes was introduced to meet the new requirements, including adding new magnets, replacing photoinjector lasers, modifying typical laser parameters, stabilizing RF systems, and changing standard operating procedures. In this paper, we discuss these modifications in detail, including the agreement between the experimental results and detailed simulations.},

Other programs include the forward parton distribution function at large xB, the quark and gluon polarized distribution functions, the measurements of electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon ground state and of nucleon resonance transitions at high Q2, and the exploration of physics beyond the Standard Model in high precision parity violating processes. The 12 GeV electron beam is also well suited to explore quark hadronization properties using the nucleus as a laboratory.},

Placing such a transformer in the feedback loop of an operational amplifier will increase the useful frequency range (active current transformer). A magnetic modulator can be added to extend the response to DC current, maintaining with a control loop the transformer core at a zero flux state. The magnetic modulator in the parametric current transformer gives not only the DC response but provides parametric signal amplification up to a transition frequency of about 500 Hz. The low frequency channel (magnetic modulator) and the high frequency channel (active current transformer) are linked together in a common feedback loop. A large dynamic range together with good linearity and low distortion is obtained. This arrangement protects the magnetic modulator from dynamic errors in case of a sudden beam loss, which could impair its zero stability. Dynamic overload protection is an important condition to obtain high resolution and good zero stability, even in applications which require in principle only a very limited frequency response.},

The calibration procedure suppresses the error due to PCT’s offset drifts by turning the beam on and off, which is invasive to the experiment. One of the goals of the system is to minimize the calibration time without compromising the measurement’s accuracy. The linearity of the cavity monitors is a critical parameter for transferring the accurate calibration done at high currents over the whole dynamic range.

	abstract = {The Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) has undertaken the 12 GeV Upgrade to double the accelerating energy of its electron beam. This attracts many interesting proposals to probe the quark-gluon nature of nuclear matter at higher energy, therefore a new set of equipment is required. Experimental Hall C of JLab has planned to construct a new Super High Momentum Spectrometer (SHMS) to replace the existing Short Orbit Spectrometer (SOS). The University of Regina is assigned to construct the Heavy Gas Cˇ erenkov (HGC) Detector as part of the SHMS focal plane detectors. This detector will be used as critical component to provide reliable π/K 
separation between 3-11 GeV/c central momenta in the SHMS experimental program. In this thesis, we will report the design, quality control studies and simulated expected performances of the HGC detector.},

	abstract = {Hadronic reactions producing strange quarks such as exclusive or semi-inclusive kaon production, play an important role in studies of hadron structure and the dynamics that bind the most basic elements of nuclear physics. The small-angle capability of the new Super High Momentum Spectrometer (SHMS) in Hall C, coupled with its high momentum reach - up to the anticipated 11-GeV beam energy in Hall C - and coincidence capability with the well-understood High Momentum Spectrometer, will allow for probes of such hadron structure involving strangeness down to the smallest distance scales to date. To cleanly select the kaons, a threshold aerogel Cerenkov detector has been constructed for the SHMS. The detector consists of an aerogel tray followed by a diffusion box. Four trays for aerogel of nominal refractive indices of n=1.030, 1.020, 1.015 and 1.011 were constructed. The tray combination will allow for identification of kaons from 1 GeV/c up to 7.2 GeV/c, reaching 10{\textasciicircum}-2 proton and 10{\textasciicircum}-3 pion rejection, with kaon detection efficiency better than 95\%. The diffusion box of the detector is equipped with 14 five-inch diameter photomultiplier tubes. Its interior walls are covered with Gore diffusive reflector, which is superior to the commonly used Millipore paper and improved the detector performance by 35\%. The inner surface of the two aerogel trays with higher refractive index is covered with Millipore paper, however, those two trays with lower aerogel refractive index are again covered with Gore diffusive reflector for higher performance. The measured mean number of photoelectrons in saturation is {\textasciitilde}12 for n=1.030, {\textasciitilde}sim8 for n=1.020, {\textasciitilde}10 for n=1.015, and {\textasciitilde}5.5 for n=1.011. The design details, the results of component characterization, and initial performance tests and optimization of the detector are presented.},

For the existing High Momentum Spectrometer (HMS) and Short Orbit Spectrometer (SOS), design considerations, relevant construction information, and comparisons of simulated and experimental rpesﬃuﬃﬃ lts are included. The energy resolution of the HMS and SOS calorimeters is better than s=E∼6\%= E and pion/electron (π=e) separation of about 100:1 has been achieved in the energy range of 1–5 GeV. Good agreement has been observed between the experimental and simulated energy resolutions, but simulations systematically exceed experimentally determined π− suppression factors by close to a factor of two. For the Super High Momentum Spectrometer (SHMS), presently under construction, details on the design and accompanying GEANT4 simulation efforts are given. The anticipated performance of the new calorimeter is predicted over the full momentum range of the SHMS. Good electron/ hadron separation is anticipated by combining the energy deposited in an initial (preshower) calorimeter layer with the total energy deposited in the calorimeter.},

In the regions where quasielastic scattering dominates the cross section (low Q$^{\textrm{2}}$ or large negative values of y), the data are shown to exhibit y-scaling.

	abstract = {Background: Measurements of forward exclusive meson production at different squared four-momenta of the exchanged virtual photon, \$Q{\textasciicircum}2\$, and at different four-momentum transfer, t, can be used to probe QCD's transition from meson-nucleon degrees of freedom at long distances to quark-gluon degrees of freedom at short scales. Ratios of separated response functions in \${\textbackslash}pi{\textasciicircum}-\$ and \${\textbackslash}pi{\textasciicircum}+\$ electroproduction are particularly informative. The ratio for transverse photons may allow this transition to be more easily observed, while the ratio for longitudinal photons provides a crucial verification of the assumed pole dominance, needed for reliable extraction of the pion form factor from electroproduction data. Method: Data were acquired with 2.6-5.2 GeV electron beams and the HMS+SOS spectrometers in Jefferson Lab Hall C, at central \$Q{\textasciicircum}2\$ values of 0.6, 1.0, 1.6 GeV\${\textasciicircum}2\$ at W=1.95 GeV, and \$Q{\textasciicircum}2\$=2.45 GeV\${\textasciicircum}2\$ at W=2.22 GeV. There was significant coverage in \${\textbackslash}phi\$ and \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$, which allowed separation of \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{L,T,LT,TT\}\$. Results: \${\textbackslash}sigma\_L\$ shows a clear signature of the pion pole, with a sharp rise at small -t. In contrast, \${\textbackslash}sigma\_T\$ is much flatter versus t. The longitudinal/transverse ratios evolve with \$Q{\textasciicircum}2\$ and t, and at the highest \$Q{\textasciicircum}2\$=2.45 GeV\${\textasciicircum}2\$ show a slight enhancement for \${\textbackslash}pi{\textasciicircum}-\$ production compared to \${\textbackslash}pi{\textasciicircum}+\$. The \${\textbackslash}pi{\textasciicircum}-/{\textbackslash}pi{\textasciicircum}+\$ ratio for transverse photons exhibits only a small \$Q{\textasciicircum}2\$-dependence, following a nearly universal curve with t, with a steep transition to a value of about 0.25, consistent with s-channel quark knockout. The \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{TT\}/{\textbackslash}sigma\_T\$ ratio also drops rapidly with \$Q{\textasciicircum}2\$, qualitatively consistent with s-channel helicity conservation. The \${\textbackslash}pi{\textasciicircum}-/{\textbackslash}pi{\textasciicircum}+\$ ratio for longitudinal photons indicates a small isoscalar contamination at W=1.95 GeV, consistent with what was observed in our earlier determination of the pion form factor at these kinematics.},

	abstract = {Quantum Chromodynamics, the theory of quarks and gluons, whose interactions can be described by a local SU(3) gauge symmetry with charges called “color quantum numbers”, is reviewed; the goal of this review is to provide advanced Ph.D. students a comprehensive handbook, helpful for their research. When QCD was “discovered” 50 years ago, the idea that quarks could exist, but not be observed, left most physicists unconvinced. Then, with the discovery of charmonium in 1974 and the explanation of its excited states using the Cornell potential, consisting of the sum of a Coulomb-like attraction and a long range linear confining potential, the theory was suddenly widely accepted. This paradigm shift is now referred to as the November revolution. It had been anticipated by the observation of scaling in deep inelastic scattering, and was followed by the discovery of gluons in three-jet events. The parameters of QCD include the running coupling constant, \$\${\textbackslash}alpha \_s(Q{\textasciicircum}2)\$\$, that varies with the energy scale \$\$Q{\textasciicircum}2\$\$characterising the interaction, and six quark masses. QCD cannot be solved analytically, at least not yet, and the large value of \$\${\textbackslash}alpha \_s\$\$at low momentum transfers limits perturbative calculations to the high-energy region where \$\$Q{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}gg {\textbackslash}varLambda \_\{\{{\textbackslash}textrm\{QCD\}\}\} {\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}simeq \$\$(250 MeV)\$\${\textasciicircum}2\$\$. Lattice QCD (LQCD), numerical calculations on a discretized space-time lattice, is discussed in detail, the dynamics of the QCD vacuum is visualized, and the expected spectra of mesons and baryons are displayed. Progress in lattice calculations of the structure of nucleons and of quantities related to the phase diagram of dense and hot (or cold) hadronic matter are reviewed. Methods and examples of how to calculate hadronic corrections to weak matrix elements on a lattice are outlined. The wide variety of analytical approximations currently in use, and the accuracy of these approximations, are reviewed. These methods range from the Bethe–Salpeter, Dyson–Schwinger coupled relativistic equations, which are formulated in both Minkowski or Euclidean spaces, to expansions of multi-quark states in a set of basis functions using light-front coordinates, to the AdS/QCD method that imbeds 4-dimensional QCD in a 5-dimensional deSitter space, allowing confinement and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking to be described in a novel way. Models that assume the number of colors is very large, i.e. make use of the large \$\$N\_c\$\$-limit, give unique insights. Many other techniques that are tailored to specific problems, such as perturbative expansions for high energy scattering or approximate calculations using the operator product expansion are discussed. The very powerful effective field theory techniques that are successful for low energy nuclear systems (chiral effective theory), or for non-relativistic systems involving heavy quarks, or the treatment of gluon exchanges between energetic, collinear partons encountered in jets, are discussed. The spectroscopy of mesons and baryons has played an important historical role in the development of QCD. The famous X,Y,Z states – and the discovery of pentaquarks – have revolutionized hadron spectroscopy; their status and interpretation are reviewed as well as recent progress in the identification of glueballs and hybrids in light-meson spectroscopy. These exotic states add to the spectrum of expected \$\$q\{\{{\textbackslash}bar\{q\}\}\}\$\$mesons and qqq baryons. The progress in understanding excitations of light and heavy baryons is discussed. The nucleon as the lightest baryon is discussed extensively, its form factors, its partonic structure and the status of the attempt to determine a three-dimensional picture of the parton distribution. An experimental program to study the phase diagram of QCD at high temperature and density started with fixed target experiments in various laboratories in the second half of the 1980s, and then, in this century, with colliders. QCD thermodynamics at high temperature became accessible to LQCD, and numerical results on chiral and deconfinement transitions and properties of the deconfined and chirally restored form of strongly interacting matter, called the Quark–Gluon Plasma (QGP), have become very precise by now. These results can now be confronted with experimental data that are sensitive to the nature of the phase transition. There is clear evidence that the QGP phase is created. This phase of QCD matter can already be characterized by some properties that indicate, within a temperature range of a few times the pseudocritical temperature, the medium behaves like a near ideal liquid. Experimental observables are presented that demonstrate deconfinement. High and ultrahigh density QCD matter at moderate and low temperatures shows interesting features and new phases that are of astrophysical relevance. They are reviewed here and some of the astrophysical implications are discussed. Perturbative QCD and methods to describe the different aspects of scattering processes are discussed. The primary parton–parton scattering in a collision is calculated in perturbative QCD with increasing complexity. The radiation of soft gluons can spoil the perturbative convergence, this can be cured by resummation techniques, which are also described here. Realistic descriptions of QCD scattering events need to model the cascade of quark and gluon splittings until hadron formation sets in, which is done by parton showers. The full event simulation can be performed with Monte Carlo event generators, which simulate the full chain from the hard interaction to the hadronic final states, including the modelling of non-perturbative components. The contribution of the LEP experiments (and of earlier collider experiments) to the study of jets is reviewed. Correlations between jets and the shape of jets had allowed the collaborations to determine the “color factors” – invariants of the SU(3) color group governing the strength of quark–gluon and gluon–gluon interactions. The calculated jet production rates (using perturbative QCD) are shown to agree precisely with data, for jet energies spanning more than five orders of magnitude. The production of jets recoiling against a vector boson, \$\$W{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}pm \$\$or Z, is shown to be well understood. The discovery of the Higgs boson was certainly an important milestone in the development of high-energy physics. The couplings of the Higgs boson to massive vector bosons and fermions that have been measured so far support its interpretation as mass-generating boson as predicted by the Standard Model. The study of the Higgs boson recoiling against hadronic jets (without or with heavy flavors) or against vector bosons is also highlighted. Apart from the description of hard interactions taking place at high energies, the understanding of “soft QCD” is also very important. In this respect, Pomeron – and Odderon – exchange, soft and hard diffraction are discussed. Weak decays of quarks and leptons, the quark mixing matrix and the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon are processes which are governed by weak interactions. However, corrections by strong interactions are important, and these are reviewed. As the measured values are incompatible with (most of) the predictions, the question arises: are these discrepancies first hints for New Physics beyond the Standard Model? This volume concludes with a description of future facilities or important upgrades of existing facilities which improve their luminosity by orders of magnitude. The best is yet to come!},

	abstract = {With discovery of the Higgs boson, the Standard Model of Particle Physics became complete. Its formulation is a remarkable story; and the process of verification is continuing, with the most important chapter being the least well understood. Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is that part of the Standard Model which is supposed to describe all of nuclear physics and yet, almost fifty years after the discovery of quarks, we are only just beginning to understand how QCD moulds the basic bricks for nuclei: pious, neutrons, protons. QCD is characterized by two emergent phenomena: confinement and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (DCSB), whose implications are extraordinary. This contribution describes how DCSB, not the Higgs boson, generates more than 98\% of the visible mass in the Universe, explains why confinement guarantees that condensates, those quantities that were commonly viewed as constant mass-scales that fill all spacetime, are instead wholly contained within hadrons, and elucidates a range of observable consequences of confinement and DCSB whose measurement is the focus of a vast international experimental programme.},

	abstract = {This thesis describes the use of Dyson-Schwinger equations (DSEs) to study baryon bound states in QCD. In this work, octet baryon axial form factors are calculated using a symmetry-preserving treatment of a vector \${\textbackslash}times\$ vector contact interaction (SCI). The baryons are considered as quark-plus-interacting-diquark bound states, whose structure (wave function) is obtained by solving a Poincar{\textbackslash}'e-covariant Faddeev equation. Since it preserves symmetries, all consequences of partial conservation of the axial current are manifest. For instance, one finds that octet baryon axial properties are consistent with only minor violations of SU(3)-flavour symmetry, being interpreted as a dynamical consequence of emergent hadron mass (EHM). Considering neutral axial currents, the SCI delivers predictions for the flavour separation of octet baryon axial charges and, consequently, produces values for the associated SU(3) singlet, triplet, and octet axial charges. The results indicate that, at the hadron scale \${\textbackslash}zeta\_\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{H\}\}\$, valence degrees of freedom carry approximately \$50{\textbackslash}\%\$ of an octet baryon's total spin. Proton structure is one of the principal topics in hadron physics. Its study is expected to reveal key features of both the origin of mass and strong interaction dynamics. This work therefore extended the above analyses to an examination of in-proton parton helicity (spin) distribution functions (DFs). Using Ans{\textbackslash}"atze for hadron-scale proton polarised valence quark DFs, predictions are delivered for all proton polarised DFs at the measurement scale \${\textbackslash}zeta\_\{{\textbackslash}rm C\}{\textasciicircum}2 = 3{\textbackslash},\$GeV\${\textasciicircum}2\$. The pointwise behaviour of the predicted DFs and, consequently, their moments, shows good agreement with results inferred from data. Based on these results, one finds that experimental measurements of the proton flavour-singlet axial charge should return a value \$a\_0{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm E\}({\textbackslash}zeta\_\{{\textbackslash}rm C\}) = 0.35(2)\$.},

	abstract = {A proof of Goldstone’s theorem is given that highlights the necessary consistency between the exact Schwinger-Dyson equation for the fermion propagator and the exact Bethe-Salpeter equation for fermion-antifermion bound states. The approach is tailored to the case when a global chiral symmetry is dynamically broken. Criteria are provided for maintaining the consistency when the exact equations are modified by approximations. In particular, for gauge theories in which partial conservation of the axial vector current (PCAC) should hold, a constraint on the approximations to the fermion–gauge-boson vertex function is discussed, and a vertex model is given which satisfies both the PCAC constraint and the vector Ward-Takahashi identity.},

	abstract = {This work is a pioneering study of backward-angle omega cross sections through the exclusive 1H(e,e'p)omega reaction using the missing mass reconstruction technique. The extracted cross sections are separated into the transverse (T), longitudinal (L), and LT, TT interference terms. The analyzed data were part of experiment E01-004 (Fpi-2), which used 2.6-5.2GeV electron beams and HMS+SOS spectrometers in Jefferson Lab Hall C. The primary objective was to detect coincidence pion in the forward-angle, where the backward-angle omega events were fortuitously detected. The experiment has central Q2 values of 1.60 and 2.45GeV2, at W=2.21GeV. There was significant coverage in phi and epsilon, which allowed separation of sigma\_T,L,LT,TT. The data set has a unique u coverage of -u{\textasciitilde}0, which corresponds to -t{\textgreater}4GeV2. The separated sigma\_T result suggest a flat {\textasciitilde}1/Q{\textasciicircum}(1.33+/-1.21) dependence, whereas sigma\_L seems to hold a stronger 1/Q{\textasciicircum}(9.43+/-6.28) dependence. The sigma\_L/sigma\_T ratio indicate sigma\_T dominance at Q2=2.45 GeV2 at the {\textasciitilde}90\% confidence level. After translating the results into the -t space of the published CLAS data, our data show evidence of a backward-angle omega electroproduction peak at both Q2 settings. Previously, this phenomenon showing both forward and backward-angle peaks was only observed in the meson photoproduction data. Through comparison of our sigma\_T data with the prediction of the Transition Distribution Amplitude (TDA) model, and signs of sigma\_T dominance, promising indications of the applicability of the TDA factorization are demonstrated at a much lower Q2 value than its preferred range of Q2{\textgreater}10GeV2. These studies have opened a new means to study the transition of the nucleon wavefunction through backward-angle experimental observables.},

At these energy and momentum transfers, calculations based on the eikonal approximation have been shown to be valid and recent experiments indicated that final state interactions are relatively small and possibly independent of missing momenta. This experiment will provide for the first time data in this kinematic regime which are of fundamental importance to the study of short range correlations and high density fluctuations in nuclei.

It is the result of a community effort, incorporating insights from a series of workshops conducted between March 2022 and April 2023. With a track record of over 25 years in delivering the world's most intense and precise multi-GeV electron beams, CEBAF's potential for a higher energy upgrade presents a unique opportunity for an innovative nuclear physics program, which seamlessly integrates a rich historical background with a promising future. The proposed physics program encompass a diverse range of investigations centered around the nonperturbative dynamics inherent in hadron structure and the exploration of strongly interacting systems. It builds upon the exceptional capabilities of CEBAF in high-luminosity operations, the availability of existing or planned Hall equipment, and recent advancements in accelerator technology. The proposed program cover various scientific topics, including Hadron Spectroscopy, Partonic Structure and Spin, Hadronization and Transverse Momentum, Spatial Structure, Mechanical Properties, Form Factors and Emergent Hadron Mass, Hadron-Quark Transition, and Nuclear Dynamics at Extreme Conditions, as well as QCD Confinement and Fundamental Symmetries. Each topic highlights the key measurements achievable at a 22 GeV CEBAF accelerator. Furthermore, this document outlines the significant physics outcomes and unique aspects of these programs that distinguish them from other existing or planned facilities. In summary, this document provides an exciting rationale for the energy upgrade of CEBAF to 22 GeV, outlining the transformative scientific potential that lies within reach, and the remarkable opportunities it offers for advancing our understanding of hadron physics and related fundamental phenomena.},
