	abstract = {This chapter is a personal account of the initial planning and competition for a new laboratory, which eventually became known as the Thomas Jeﬀerson National Accelerator Facility, with the oﬃcial nickname “Jeﬀerson Lab.” The period covered starts as far back as 1964, with the introduction of quarks, and extends up to the late 1980s after the initial team was assembled, the superconducting design was in place, and construction was well underway. I describe some of the major experiments that were proposed to justify the laboratory, reﬂect on the present status of those initially proposed experiments, and very brieﬂy outline some of the new ideas that emerged after the laboratory was constructed. The science is presented in a simple manner intended for a lay audience, with some of the ideas illustrated by cartoons that were often used in popular lectures given during this period.},
