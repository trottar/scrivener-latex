	abstract = {The Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) has undertaken the 12 GeV Upgrade to double the accelerating energy of its electron beam. This attracts many interesting proposals to probe the quark-gluon nature of nuclear matter at higher energy, therefore a new set of equipment is required. Experimental Hall C of JLab has planned to construct a new Super High Momentum Spectrometer (SHMS) to replace the existing Short Orbit Spectrometer (SOS). The University of Regina is assigned to construct the Heavy Gas Cˇ erenkov (HGC) Detector as part of the SHMS focal plane detectors. This detector will be used as critical component to provide reliable π/K 
separation between 3-11 GeV/c central momenta in the SHMS experimental program. In this thesis, we will report the design, quality control studies and simulated expected performances of the HGC detector.},

	abstract = {Hadronic reactions producing strange quarks such as exclusive or semi-inclusive kaon production, play an important role in studies of hadron structure and the dynamics that bind the most basic elements of nuclear physics. The small-angle capability of the new Super High Momentum Spectrometer (SHMS) in Hall C, coupled with its high momentum reach - up to the anticipated 11-GeV beam energy in Hall C - and coincidence capability with the well-understood High Momentum Spectrometer, will allow for probes of such hadron structure involving strangeness down to the smallest distance scales to date. To cleanly select the kaons, a threshold aerogel Cerenkov detector has been constructed for the SHMS. The detector consists of an aerogel tray followed by a diffusion box. Four trays for aerogel of nominal refractive indices of n=1.030, 1.020, 1.015 and 1.011 were constructed. The tray combination will allow for identification of kaons from 1 GeV/c up to 7.2 GeV/c, reaching 10{\textasciicircum}-2 proton and 10{\textasciicircum}-3 pion rejection, with kaon detection efficiency better than 95\%. The diffusion box of the detector is equipped with 14 five-inch diameter photomultiplier tubes. Its interior walls are covered with Gore diffusive reflector, which is superior to the commonly used Millipore paper and improved the detector performance by 35\%. The inner surface of the two aerogel trays with higher refractive index is covered with Millipore paper, however, those two trays with lower aerogel refractive index are again covered with Gore diffusive reflector for higher performance. The measured mean number of photoelectrons in saturation is {\textasciitilde}12 for n=1.030, {\textasciitilde}sim8 for n=1.020, {\textasciitilde}10 for n=1.015, and {\textasciitilde}5.5 for n=1.011. The design details, the results of component characterization, and initial performance tests and optimization of the detector are presented.},

	abstract = {The electromagnetic calorimeters of the various magnetic spectrometers in Hall C at Jefferson Lab are presented. For the existing High Momentum Spectrometer (HMS) and Short Orbit Spectrometer (SOS), design considerations, relevant construction information, and comparisons of simulated and experimental rpesﬃuﬃﬃ lts are included. The energy resolution of the HMS and SOS calorimeters is better than s=E∼6\%= E and pion/electron (π=e) separation of about 100:1 has been achieved in the energy range of 1–5 GeV. Good agreement has been observed between the experimental and simulated energy resolutions, but simulations systematically exceed experimentally determined π− suppression factors by close to a factor of two. For the Super High Momentum Spectrometer (SHMS), presently under construction, details on the design and accompanying GEANT4 simulation efforts are given. The anticipated performance of the new calorimeter is predicted over the full momentum range of the SHMS. Good electron/ hadron separation is anticipated by combining the energy deposited in an initial (preshower) calorimeter layer with the total energy deposited in the calorimeter.},
