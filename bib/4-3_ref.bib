	abstract = {COSY INFINITY is a design and simulation code for particle accelerators, guidance systems, and spectrometers utilizing novel techniques. It allows the computation and manipulation of maps of arbitrary systems including fringe fields and other s-dependent effects to arbitrary order, including the dependence of system parameters. Maps can be analyzed and manipulated in a variety of ways, including normal form techniques. COSY's object-oriented language concept allows very complicated layouts, boundary conditions, optimizations strategies and control requirements to be phrased in a very natural way and also provides a very powerful environment to treat general problems with differential algebraic methods. Besides its analytical power, the code allows a highly interactive graphics-based study and design of systems.{\textless}{\textgreater}},
