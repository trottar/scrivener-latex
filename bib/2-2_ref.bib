	abstract = {The \${\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$H\$(e,e'p)n\$ cross sections have been measured at negative 4-momentum transfers of \$Q{\textasciicircum}\{2\} = 4.5{\textbackslash}pm0.5\$ (GeV/c)\${\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$ and \$Q{\textasciicircum}\{2\} = 3.5{\textbackslash}pm0.5\$ (GeV/c)\${\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$ reaching neutron recoil (missing) momenta up to \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{r\}\}{\textbackslash}sim\$1.0 GeV/c. The data have been obtained at fixed neutron recoil angles \$5{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}{\textbackslash}leq{\textbackslash}theta\_\{nq\}{\textbackslash}leq95{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ with respect to the 3-momentum transfer \${\textbackslash}vec\{q\}\$. The new data agree well with the previous data which reached \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{r\}\}{\textbackslash}sim550\$ MeV/c. At \${\textbackslash}theta\_\{nq\}=35{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ and \$45{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$, final state interactions (FSI), meson exchange currents (MEC) and isobar configurations (IC) are suppressed and the plane wave impulse approximation (PWIA) provides the dominant cross section contribution. The new data are compared to recent theoretical calculations, and a significant disagreement for recoil momenta \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{r\}\}{\textgreater}700\$ MeV/c is observed.},

Superharps allow for high precision measurements of the beam's profile and position (Δx ∼ 10 μm). The Hall C endstation at CEBAF will use three pairs of superharps to perform beam energy measurements with 10−3 accuracy. The three pairs are installed at the beginning, the mid-point and the end of the Hall C arc beamline. Using superharps in conjunction with a dual sensor system: the direct current pick-up and the bremsstrahlung detectors, beam profile measurements can be obtained over a wide beam current range of 1 ∼ 200 μA.},

The system generates a rectangular raster pattern with highly uniform (∼95\%) raster density distribution on cryogenic targets. The two raster frequencies are 24.96 and 25.08kHz. The turning time at the vertex is 200ns and the scan linearity is 98\%. The beam-heating effect on the target is effectively eliminated. The new raster system allows the use of higher beam current toward 200μA in many of the experimental proposals at end station Hall A and Hall C of the Jefferson lab.},

We propose to insert pairs of wire scanners at the entrance and exit of the arc to measure beam position and direction. These measurements, together with a calibrated dipole field, obtain an absolute beam energy measurement with N lo-’ accuracy, according to error analyses. In operational mode, arc quads and sextupoles are powered to obtain a second order achromat with a dispersion of 2.1 cm/\% at the arc center. A wire scanner at the arc center then obtains a relative energy measurement of N 10m4 accuracy.},

	abstract = {Toroidal transformers are used to measure the beam current in beam lines and accelerators. Placing such a transformer in the feedback loop of an operational amplifier will increase the useful frequency range (active current transformer). A magnetic modulator can be added to extend the response to DC current, maintaining with a control loop the transformer core at a zero flux state. The magnetic modulator in the parametric current transformer gives not only the DC response but provides parametric signal amplification up to a transition frequency of about 500 Hz. The low frequency channel (magnetic modulator) and the high frequency channel (active current transformer) are linked together in a common feedback loop. A large dynamic range together with good linearity and low distortion is obtained. This arrangement protects the magnetic modulator from dynamic errors in case of a sudden beam loss, which could impair its zero stability. Dynamic overload protection is an important condition to obtain high resolution and good zero stability, even in applications which require in principle only a very limited frequency response.},

In Hall A, all experiments require continuous, non-invasive current measurements and a few experiments require an absolute accuracy of 0.2 \% in the current range from 1 to 180 \$  A Parametric Current Transformer (PCT), manufactured by Bergoz, has an accurate and stable sensitivity of 4 \$ 9  EXW LWV RIIVHW GULIWV DW WKH \$ OHYHO RYHU WLPH preclude its direct use for continuous measurements. Two cavity monitors are calibrated against the PCT with at least 50 µA of beam current. The calibration procedure suppresses the error due to PCT’s offset drifts by turning the beam on and off, which is invasive to the experiment. One of the goals of the system is to minimize the calibration time without compromising the measurement’s accuracy. The linearity of the cavity monitors is a critical parameter for transferring the accurate calibration done at high currents over the whole dynamic range. The method for measuring accurately the linearity is described.},
