	abstract = {The \${\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$H\$(e,e'p)n\$ cross sections have been measured at negative 4-momentum transfers of \$Q{\textasciicircum}\{2\} = 4.5{\textbackslash}pm0.5\$ (GeV/c)\${\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$ and \$Q{\textasciicircum}\{2\} = 3.5{\textbackslash}pm0.5\$ (GeV/c)\${\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$ reaching neutron recoil (missing) momenta up to \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{r\}\}{\textbackslash}sim\$1.0 GeV/c. The data have been obtained at fixed neutron recoil angles \$5{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}{\textbackslash}leq{\textbackslash}theta\_\{nq\}{\textbackslash}leq95{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ with respect to the 3-momentum transfer \${\textbackslash}vec\{q\}\$. The new data agree well with the previous data which reached \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{r\}\}{\textbackslash}sim550\$ MeV/c. At \${\textbackslash}theta\_\{nq\}=35{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ and \$45{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$, final state interactions (FSI), meson exchange currents (MEC) and isobar configurations (IC) are suppressed and the plane wave impulse approximation (PWIA) provides the dominant cross section contribution. The new data are compared to recent theoretical calculations, and a significant disagreement for recoil momenta \$p\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{r\}\}{\textgreater}700\$ MeV/c is observed.},

	abstract = {The CEBAF superharp is an upgraded beam wire scanner which provides absolute beam position readout using a shaft encoder. Superharps allow for high precision measurements of the beam's profile and position (Δx ∼ 10 μm). The Hall C endstation at CEBAF will use three pairs of superharps to perform beam energy measurements with 10−3 accuracy. The three pairs are installed at the beginning, the mid-point and the end of the Hall C arc beamline. Using superharps in conjunction with a dual sensor system: the direct current pick-up and the bremsstrahlung detectors, beam profile measurements can be obtained over a wide beam current range of 1 ∼ 200 μA.},
