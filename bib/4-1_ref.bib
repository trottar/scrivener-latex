	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}CEBAF experiment e89-008 measured inclusive electron scattering from nuclei in a Q$^{\textrm{2}}$ range between 0.8 and 7.3 (GeV/c)$^{\textrm{2}}$ for x$_{\textrm{Bjorken}}$ ≳ 1. The cross sections for scattering from D, C, Fe, and Au were measured. The C, Fe, and Au data have been analyzed in terms of F(y) to examine y-scaling of the quasielastic scattering, and to study the momentum distribution of the nucleons in the nucleus. The data have also been analyzed in terms of the structure function νW$_{\textrm{2}}$ to examine scaling of the inelastic scattering in x and ξ, and to study the momentum distribution of the quarks. In the regions where quasielastic scattering dominates the cross section (low Q$^{\textrm{2}}$ or large negative values of y), the data are shown to exhibit y-scaling. However, the y-scaling breaks down once the inelastic contributions become large. The data do not exhibit x-scaling, except at the lowest values of x, while the structure function does appear to scale in the Nachtmann variable, ξ.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
